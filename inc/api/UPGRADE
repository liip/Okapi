UPGRADE GUIDE TO OKAPI2
=======================

Backwards Compatibility Breaks
------------------------------

* api_response::setCookie() :
  - $maxage is now $expires which should be a unix timestamp and not
    a duration in seconds, max-age isn't supported in all browsers.
  - $httpOnly now defaults to true since it's a more secure default,
    set it to false if you really need to read cookies from javascript.
    This does not affect XHR though, so it is seldomly needed.

New Features
------------

* You can have a local _my.yml file that will take over the default 
  okapi conf, for dev setups that shouldn't be committed

TO BE DOCUMENTED:
- routes
- exceptions
- core stuff (yaml conf etc)
- Iauth
