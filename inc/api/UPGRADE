UPGRADE GUIDE TO OKAPI2
=======================

Backwards Compatibility Breaks
------------------------------

* api_response::setCookie() :
  - $maxage is now $expires which should be a unix timestamp and not
    a duration in seconds, max-age isn't supported in all browsers.
  - $httpOnly now defaults to true since it's a more secure default,
    set it to false if you really need to read cookies from javascript.
    This does not affect XHR though, so it is seldomly needed.


TO BE DOCUMENTED:
- routes
- exceptions
- core stuff (?)
