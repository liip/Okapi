DESCRIPTION:

    Okapi is a lean web framework optimized for processing of XML pipelines.
    
    It has the following features:
    
        - Parse incoming URLs and call configured commands (api_routing)
        - Commands to collect some data from models and put it in an XML DOM structure (api_command)
        - Models which provide XML representation of a diverse set of data (api_model and it's subclasses)
        - Views that use XSLT for templating (api_views_common and children)
        - Context-aware configuration handling (api_config)
        - Uniform and configurable exception handling (api_exceptionhandler and api_exception)
        - Internationalisation of output (api_i18n)
