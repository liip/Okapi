    (alain)

    paths. (pneff)
  - api_exceptionhandler: Remove type hinting which makes Okapi compatible
    with PHP 5.1 again. (chregu)

    instead returning a modified array. This may break compatibility for
    projects that subclass api_config.

    expressions for path matching. (marc)
  - api_config: Fix writing of cache files with environment keys.
    (lukas.smith)
  - api_testing_case_functional: Use PATH_SEPARATOR instead of hard-coded

    double / in the file path. (lukas.smith)
  - api_routing: Enable subdomain matching for routing. (pneff)

    full user identity. (fabian.vogler)

    that overload the standard config. (lukas.smith)

    extension. (lukas.smith)

    throws an exception in the constructor. (lukas.smith)

  - api_exceptionhandler_default: Fix massaging of stackrace to avoid
    overwriting by-reference variables. (pneff)
  - api_exception_XsltParseError: Added XSL parse error to the exception
    message. (marc)

    has been output. (lukas.smith)

2008-08-29 :: Version 1.1.3
  - api_cache: Fix get() method. Major fuckup by me. (pneff)
  - api_model_queryinfo: Make sure ? is only included in the URL if there are
    parameters. (pneff)

2008-08-29 :: Version 1.1.2

  - api_cache: Unify key handling by moving the logic into a method. (pneff)

    subclasses. (lejoe)
  - api_helpers_string: escapeJSValue also escapes \r. (pneff)
  - api_model_queryinfo: Modified to nicely handle "Array" parameters and use
    the PHP function http_build_query to create the reqestURI parameters.
    (ebi)
  - api_helpers_xpath: Trim the return value of getText() method. (pierre)
  - api_routing: Allow 0 as a URL parameter. This was ignored so far because
    we used empty() to test the value and empty() returns true for '0'.
    (pneff)

2008-08-08 :: Version 1.1.1
  - api_response has support for outputting a content length header. (pneff)
  - api_request: New method getClientIp. This returns the real client IP,
    using any request headers that proxies and load balancers set to pass
    through to communicate the original client IP address. (pneff)
  - Disable DOM dumping (XML=1 hack) by default and provide the config option
    allowDomDump to enable it. (pneff)
  - Switch to a patched copy of Symfony YAML. This is only a temporary
    solution until Symfony has a stable branch with their YAML parser. (pneff)

2008-07-08 :: Version 1.1.0
  - IMPORTANT: This release breaks API compatibility to 1.0.* due to the
    YAML parser switch and the change in the isAllowed() behaviour.
  - Added Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable as authentication-adapter. (alain)
  - Added the functionality to define an extension node in the config
    for the allowed extensions. Syntax is documented and is like:
    "extensions: [xml, rss, html]" only these extensions are then parsed
    as extensions. (marc)
  - Added the possibility to overwrite the "entry" values of
    api_helpers_xml::array2dom. (marc)
  - Use sfYaml class for parsing YAML instead of Spyc. (lukas.smith)
  - Unit and functional testing framework. (ebi, pneff)
  - Handle return from isAllowed() call. Now throws CommandNotAllowed
    exception if false is returned. (lukas.smith)

    setting for the cache file (lukas.smith)
